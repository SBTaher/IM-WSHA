# IM-WSHA-
We have introduced a smart home dataset using three triaxial IMU(inertial measurement unit) sensors attached to the subject wrist, chest, and thigh region to capture important aspects of human motion. The dataset represents motion data captured while subjects are involved in performing 11 different (static and dynamic) smart home activities: Using Computer (1min), phone conversation (1 min), vacuum cleaning (1min), reading book (1 min), watching tv(1 min) , ironing (1 min), walking (1 min), exercise (1 min), cooking (1 min), drinking (20 times), brushing hair (20 times). The subjects involved both young and old volunteers who aged between 19-60 with having weight ranging between 55-85 kgs. Due to multi-sensor environment, most of the movements in activities are highly similar to each other, which make this dataset quite challenging. - Dataset includes 220 sequences of inertial data from three body worn inertial measurement unit sensors with variable time duration (between 45s to 60s) - For training the system, we used 10 subjects who performed activities in repetitive in nature. - In testing sets, we used a combination of repetitive and passive movement from each activity set.
